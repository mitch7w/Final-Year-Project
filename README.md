ISG Undergraduate Project Student of H Grobler: ML Williams (18013555), Assigned project: HG9: Real-time hand gesture control of a virtual object in augmented reality

## Project Scope

The use of Augmented Reality (AR) has numerous potential engineering applications, amongst other new approaches to interactive system control. In this project the student will develop from first principles a system which will allow real-time control/manipulation of a virtual object in AR using hand motion and gestures.

Many if not most existing AR hand gesture control systems detect the hand using markers or other supplementary aids. For this project the aim is to implement the hand tracking in real-time without the use of hand markers, etc. The system must be demonstrated to work in a standard office environment.
